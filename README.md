Overview of the Project

This is a mini e-commerce project where normal customers will only see the main page that displays the products and admins which have some hidden pages that can be accessed through Authorization only [sign up, sign in].

Admins can:

-> Create a new user (sign up)

-> Log in with the user that they have created.

->  Logout

-> Add a new product.

->  Delete an existing product.

Normal users(unauthorized) will only see the main page which contains the products.

 Starting the app:

Run Nodemon server.js on the terminal and then run http://localhost:4000/ on the browser.
